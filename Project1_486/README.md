**Topic**
I will be researching the relationship between the ridership of various stations in and about Baltimore City as it relates to the affluence of the area surrounding it. Idea/research from: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143622817307166

**Data**
I will gather data from Maryland’s IMAP/Open Data platform which includes geojsons of Baltimore Lightrail Link and Metro Link stations with their ridership. I will also pull Census/ACS data for block group level income data (median household) also in the geojson format.  

**Subsets**
The Lightrail and Metro data in its full form will most likely be left alone, however some of the Census data I may have to subset to greater Baltimore though information on areas where the Lightrail and Metro don’t run may add to the analysis. This means that at the very least the block groups outside of baltimore city along either transit corridor will be used for analysis and possibly areas along proposed or old transit corridors.

**Analysis**
I will look at the median household income within a certain buffer from each station and if possible, over different periods of time. I will classify the stations by a standard schema that represents a stations average rider income. I will then look at the ridership for each station to see if there are any patterns between certain station’s block group median household income and the ridership especially how it changes with time. 

**Output**
I will produce maps to highlight my findings both by individually looking at income and stations, and by looking at ridership and its location which may show patterns or groupings of stations where a pattern appears.
