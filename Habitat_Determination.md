## GES 386 Lab Practical

**Project description:** This project was a lab practical designed to test GIS skills in geospatial analysis by giving a number of conditions for the likely habitat area for a hypothetical creature (Gremlins) within the city of Baltimore. 

### Analysis

Dr. Alan Yeakley provided the following statement to assist in the analysis
1) Gremlins fear death by total immersion in water, and are never found within 250 m of a MAJOR WATER BODY 
2) Gremlins fear forests and should not be present within a FORESTED ZONE 
3) Gremlins fear cats, and cats like vacant lots. If there are BROWNFIELD SITES or VACANT LOTS within a 0.5 km radius of a determination area, gremlins will not be present.  
4) They prefer areas where there are more children (aged 0-17) than seniors over age 65. 
5) They prefer areas where the male to female ratio is greater than or equal to 55%. 
6) They are likely to be in RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS with higher than average population density

### Final Product

The map on the previous page was the final habitat area after careful consideration of these guidelines
