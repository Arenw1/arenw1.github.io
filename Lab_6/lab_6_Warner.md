## Tweets about COVID-19 vs. The Economy

**Project description:** 
This map was created for GES 486, Lab 6. This map shows the Continental United States classified at the state level by the number of tweets containing the words "economy" or 'COVID-19". Each state is classified by either having more tweets about COVID-19, the economy, or the same number of each. 
### Analysis
The tweets were gathered by running the search_tweets function of rtweet in R and grabbing geocoded tweets in the US containing each term. The tweets were brought into QGIS as points where a count by each state was done for both terms and the states were conditionally symbolized based on the higher value. 

The symbology is not meant to suggest any patterns.
