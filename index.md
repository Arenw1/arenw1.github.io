[Baltimore Lightrail Study](Project1_486/Baltimore_transit_study.md)
<img src="../projects/BG_map.pdf"/>
Project 1 for GES 486 - Advanced GIS

[World Photo Map](projects/qgis2web_2020_02_25-10_33_20_132185/index.html)
<img src="images/webmap_sc.PNG"/>
This map shows photos from different trips I have gone on recently. There is also a layer that shows the "field of view" created from wedge buffers using the photo's orientation (Idea from: https://communityhealthmaps.nlm.nih.gov/2019/02/21/mapping-field-photos-in-qgis/). Some of the landscape oriented photos are sideways so I am still working on that  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
